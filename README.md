A minimal theme for rofi that displays your wallpaper and the menu list, nothinging else.

It uses the Inter font, so you will need to install that (or change it to your preference).

The selected text colour can be changed by modifying the text-color under 'element-text selected'.

## Install rofi

On Debian / Ubuntu : apt-get install rofi <br>
On Arch / Arch-based : pacman -S rofi <br>
On Fedora : dnf install rofi
